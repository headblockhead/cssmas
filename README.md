# CSSmas (nojs-snowfall)
An ultra-simple website featuring **no Javascript**, with a lovely animated wintery background.

No-JavaScript means that all the animations were written in CSS only, so the page works perfectly even when JavaScript is disabled, which is common for people who have security or privacy concerns.

(as running random script code in-browser from any website you visit isn't the best idea if you like to know exactly what's happening on your computer, even when tabs are isolated from eachother)

Sadly most modern websites require JavaScript enabled to work, so it's nice to make something without JavaScript once in a while.

Have a merry Christmas!
